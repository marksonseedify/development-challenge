# development-challenge

The challenge consists on a landing page capable of generating a functional, shortened link based on an input of a URL. This project will evaluate the developer's skills and code quality when transforming a layout in a functional prototype, along with the backend and frontend properly separated.

The URL shortener must be implemented at the backend together with a validator, which must be able to indicate if the generated link is actually working. The communication between backend and frontend must be handled by a RESTful API, where the results will be shown.

It's expected that on top of shortening a URL, we are also able to keep an access count, so each time the URL is accessed, we can track a list of these accumulated values and rank the URLs properly.

All data must be saved on a database.

### Instructions

- Just work on the react part of the project if you-re applying for a *frontend developer* position.
- Using this repository, work on the challenge by creating a branch with your name (example: `name-surname`).
- A considerable part of your goal deals with transforming the mockup into a working prototype.
- On your project, create a repository called 'project'. All files that you create must be inside this folder.
- When you're done with your challenge, open a Pull Request with your changes.

### Requirements

- Follow [figma's](https://www.figma.com/file/FBYOh9ep1YzjMszP0jKBpO/URL-Shortener?node-id=0%3A1) design specification
- The frontend must be developed using the React framework
- The backend must be developed using the Node.js framework
